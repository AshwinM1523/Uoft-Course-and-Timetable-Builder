# Uoft Course Planner App

This project aims to assist both students and UofT administrators by creating a dedicated app to manage courses

## Students
Students can sign up and browse through available courses at UofT, search for when courses are offered, and generate a timeline for their future course path.

One of the primary benefits of the UofT Course Planner App is its ability to generate a future timeline using our generative algorithm. For example, if you are a first-year student wanting to take a 4th-year course, the app will create a timeline of the courses that need to be taken prior to the desired course and indicate when these courses should be taken.

## Admins
UofT administrators have the capability to create courses and include necessary information such as the course name, course code, course schedule, prerequisites, and more. Administrators can also manage and make future edits to the courses.
